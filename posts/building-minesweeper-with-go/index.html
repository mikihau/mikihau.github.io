            <p>After going through the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/list">Tour of Go</a> I started my first toy program &ndash; the game of Minesweeper (<a href="https://github.com/mikihau/minesweeper">on github</a>). To exercise what I have gotten down with Go I had a couple of things in mind about this program before I started:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should be feature complete &ndash; just all things you can do with the game.</li>
<li>It should only depend on the standard library, so that I can focus on the basics.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I finished it turned out like this:
<img src="/images/minesweeper-demo.gif" alt="Demo" /></p>

<p>Pretty sweet!</p>

<p>As a newbie Gopher I think it&rsquo;ll be helpful to write down things I learned, and ideas for improvement while working on this initial version. Here they are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Every assignment creates a (shallow) copy.</strong> I was caught by surprise while working on the recursive <code>explore()</code> function, where I want to get hold of a cell by its coordinates within the board, then modify some properties of the cell.</p>

<p>This works:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">cell := &amp;b.grid[x][y]
cell.revealed = true // was previously false
</code></pre>

<p>This also works:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">b.grid[x][y].revealed = true
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t work:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">cell := b.grid[x][y]
cell.revealed = true // was previously false
</code></pre>

<p>Coming from the Python world I had assumed the third variation would have worked, because well, the the grid hold the cell object, so it should be equivalent to saying <code>b.grid[x][y].revealed = true</code>. Turned out it&rsquo;s not the case. Under the hood, the assignment copies the content of the cell, and gives me that copy. So whatever I do with <code>cell</code> has nothing to do with <code>b.grid[x][y]</code> because they&rsquo;re two seperate objects. The caveat here is that the copy made by assignment is shallow. If a cell contains references, e.g. arrays/slices/pointers/maps/functions/channels (what about structs?), then the copied struct still holds on to those same objects in those fields, because they have the references copied.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Duck typing is out (or at least out of easy reach).</strong> This issue came up when I was trying to validate user inputs from the command line. In my program, some command handlers expect string arguments, and some expect ints. If I were to do this in Python, I&rsquo;d be happy to write a function that returns a list of arguments (of the type that the handler expect) after sanitizing the inputs. But in Go <em>you can&rsquo;t return a slice of an undetermined type</em>, regardless of type homogeneity within that slice. This really calls out for generics, which Go intentionally doesn&rsquo;t offer (for good reasons!). Without generics I suspect it can probably be done with some sort of <code>interface{}</code> and/or reflection, but fighting with the type system usually means there are better ways to do it &ndash; I&rsquo;ll be on the look out.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Abstractions with structs + interfaces vs classes.</strong> From what I get from the Tour of Go, a struct is a collection of fields, and an interface is a collection of method signatures. It came as an afterthought to me that if I combine these two features together, I get what I would normally expect for a class as an OOP language. As an example, in the code I have this lengthy switch statement taking care of all argument validation, and executing commands. What I could have done is to abstract the command as an interface, and each command (<code>new</code>, <code>reveal</code>, <code>flag</code>, <code>exit</code>, and <code>help</code>) gets to keep its own set of fields, and have its own behavior for validation, execution and exit.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type command interface {
    validate func(string) ([]string, error)
    execute  func(*board, []int)
    exit     func(board)
}
</code></pre>

<p>For example, the <code>reveal</code> command can be defined as the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type revealCommand struct {
    numArgs int
    args    []int
}

func (r revealCommand) validate(input string) error {
    parsedArgs := strings.Fields(input)
    if len(parsedArgs) != r.numArgs {
        return fmt.Errorf(&quot;Wrong number of arguments: expecting %v, got %v -- type 'h' for help&quot;, r.numArgs, len(parsedArgs))
    }

    for i, arg := range parsedArgs {
        if value, err := strconv.Atoi(arg); err == nil {
            r.args[i] = value
        } else {
            return fmt.Errorf(&quot;Expecting integer arguments -- type 'h' for help&quot;)
        }
    }
    return nil
}

func (r revealCommand) execute(b *board) {
    b.updateOnReveal(r.args)
}

func (r revealCommand) exit(b board) {
    fmt.Println(b)
}
</code></pre>

<p>This set up simplifies the main eval loop. After instantiating a command, all we have to do  is to call <code>validate()</code>, <code>execute()</code> and <code>exit()</code> on it.</p></li>

<li><p>Spice it up with goroutines? No thanks, not for minesweeper. In this game, all board updates are just changing some bits in memory, so it can happen synchronously. Plus we&rsquo;re constantly waiting on user inputs, one move at a time &ndash; there can be better situations where concurrency is actually useful.</p></li>
</ol>
