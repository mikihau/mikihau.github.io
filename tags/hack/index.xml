      <description>Just went through the excitement of publishing my first Chrome Extension, Douban Dousay filter (Chrome Web Store) (github). The code and feature itself is dead simple (~60 lines of javascript), but I just want to make a point for those who thinks making a Chrome Extension is a huge commitment or something. No, it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty easy to get started.
What I built was a filter for a social network site.</description>

      <description>After going through the Tour of Go I started my first toy program &amp;ndash; the game of Minesweeper (on github). To exercise what I have gotten down with Go I had a couple of things in mind about this program before I started:
It should be feature complete &amp;ndash; just all things you can do with the game. It should only depend on the standard library, so that I can focus on the basics.</description>
