      <description>This is my blog where I jot down things that I believe are worth sharing, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for the benefit of someone else on the internet, or simply for my own recollection. It&amp;rsquo;s also a platform for showing off what I&amp;rsquo;ve done. With that in mind, I strive to keep this blog focused on technical content, covering topics such as coding, software development, and programming career.</description>

      <title>Operating Akkoma</title>

      <description>A couple of months into self-hosting my Akkoma instance, I find myself doing a couple of operational tasks at a recurring basis. So might as well write them down here for future reference. Again, this is on my ARM-based machine with Ubuntu 22.04, where Akkoma is installed from source.
Backing Up (Periodically) The doc&amp;rsquo;s backup instructions essentially says we should back up the database, plus a couple of configs and static files/directories.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to self-host my own Akkoma (a hard fork of Pleroma) instance, after actively and happily using Mastodon for 2.5 years. Inspired by The Teabag Ninja&amp;rsquo;s awesome and detailed writeup on Akkoma&amp;rsquo;s OTP install, I&amp;rsquo;m also sharing my source installation notes along the way for all the folks on the internet, including my future self &amp;ndash; since I did have a few surprises during the process.
Unless otherwise noted, all commands below are tested on an ARM-based machine with Ubuntu 22.</description>

      <title>Reflecting On My Interviewing Experience As a Mid Level(TM) Software Engineer</title>

      <description>Having recently spent a couple of months looking for my next career opportunity, I think it&amp;rsquo;d be great to write down my interviewing experience, and my personal comments to them. Throughout the process I&amp;rsquo;ve learned some things about companies, some things about tech careers, and some things about myself. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this will shed some light on how we&amp;rsquo;re currently interviewing software engineers as an industry. The particular experience varies a lot by the individual, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure my experience covers at least some of the common cases.</description>

      <title>Publishing My First Chrome Extension</title>
      <link>https://mikihau.github.io/posts/publishing-my-first-chrome-extension/</link>

      <description>Just went through the excitement of publishing my first Chrome Extension, Douban Dousay filter (Chrome Web Store) (github). The code and feature itself is dead simple (~60 lines of javascript), but I just want to make a point for those who thinks making a Chrome Extension is a huge commitment or something. No, it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty easy to get started.
What I built was a filter for a social network site.</description>

      <title>Book Review: The Manager&#39;s Path</title>

      <description>My Expectations I decided to pick up this book for a couple of reasons. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been looking for a description of what a manager does, or should do, at tech companies. I&amp;rsquo;ve personally worked with a couple of managers so far, and each of them manage with distinctive styles, that I find myself agree/disagree with. I&amp;rsquo;d like to have a set of basic expectations for managers, and learn to understand things from the management&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>

      <description>After going through the Tour of Go I started my first toy program &amp;ndash; the game of Minesweeper (on github). To exercise what I have gotten down with Go I had a couple of things in mind about this program before I started:
It should be feature complete &amp;ndash; just all things you can do with the game. It should only depend on the standard library, so that I can focus on the basics.</description>
