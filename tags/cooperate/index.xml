      <description>Having recently spent a couple of months looking for my next career opportunity, I think it&amp;rsquo;d be great to write down my interviewing experience, and my personal comments to them. Throughout the process I&amp;rsquo;ve learned some things about companies, some things about tech careers, and some things about myself. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this will shed some light on how we&amp;rsquo;re currently interviewing software engineers as an industry. The particular experience varies a lot by the individual, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure my experience covers at least some of the common cases.</description>

      <description>My Expectations I decided to pick up this book for a couple of reasons. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been looking for a description of what a manager does, or should do, at tech companies. I&amp;rsquo;ve personally worked with a couple of managers so far, and each of them manage with distinctive styles, that I find myself agree/disagree with. I&amp;rsquo;d like to have a set of basic expectations for managers, and learn to understand things from the management&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>
