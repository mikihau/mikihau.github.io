      <description>A couple of months into self-hosting my Akkoma instance, I find myself doing a couple of operational tasks at a recurring basis. So might as well write them down here for future reference. Again, this is on my ARM-based machine with Ubuntu 22.04, where Akkoma is installed from source.
Backing Up (Periodically) The doc&amp;rsquo;s backup instructions essentially says we should back up the database, plus a couple of configs and static files/directories.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to self-host my own Akkoma (a hard fork of Pleroma) instance, after actively and happily using Mastodon for 2.5 years. Inspired by The Teabag Ninja&amp;rsquo;s awesome and detailed writeup on Akkoma&amp;rsquo;s OTP install, I&amp;rsquo;m also sharing my source installation notes along the way for all the folks on the internet, including my future self &amp;ndash; since I did have a few surprises during the process.
Unless otherwise noted, all commands below are tested on an ARM-based machine with Ubuntu 22.</description>
