      <description>My Expectations I decided to pick up this book for a couple of reasons. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been looking for a description of what a manager does, or should do, at tech companies. I&amp;rsquo;ve personally worked with a couple of managers so far, and each of them manage with distinctive styles, that I find myself agree/disagree with. I&amp;rsquo;d like to have a set of basic expectations for managers, and learn to understand things from the management&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>

      <description>After going through the Tour of Go I started my first toy program &amp;ndash; the game of Minesweeper (on github). To exercise what I have gotten down with Go I had a couple of things in mind about this program before I started:
 It should be feature complete &amp;ndash; just all things you can do with the game. It should only depend on the standard library, so that I can focus on the basics.</description>
